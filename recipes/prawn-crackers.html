    <h2>Prawn crackers are tasty prawn-flavored crisps that puff up when deep-fried. Prawn crackers are very addictive despite the fact that their texture has been compared to Styrofoam. They make a great snack food for kids and adults alike and go very well with beer.</h2>

  <h2>Method:</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Heat the oil to 182<sup>C</sup> to deep-fry the prawn chips. To find out if the oil is hot enough either use a deep-fry thermometer or place a cooking chopstick or a wooden spoon upright in the middle of the wok (as shown in the photo). If bubbles start forming around the chopstick or wooden spoon immediately, the oil is ready.</li>
      <li>Carefully place 5 to 6 chips in the hot oil, separating them if needed. Adding more than that can overcrowd the wok and lower the oil temperature, making the crackers taste greasy.</li>
      <li>Deep-fry the chips for 5 seconds or less (until they puff up).</li>
      <li>Remove the prawn crackers from the wokâ€”it's easiest to do this quickly if you have a strainer. Drain the prawn crackers on paper towels. Use a fresh paper towel to drain each batch of chips.</li>
      <li>Prawn crackers taste best served warm. If not serving immediately, store in a sealed container and briefly reheat in the oven before serving. Peanut sauce is the traditional accompaniment for prawn crackers. What to drink with prawn crackers? Beer, of course, or perhaps a Johannesburg Reisling.</li>

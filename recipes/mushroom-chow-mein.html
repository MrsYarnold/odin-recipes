  </ul>

  <h2>Method:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the dried noodles in a heatproof bowl and add boiling water from the kettle. They will take approximately five minutes to cook and this is fun for children to watch but be careful of the hot water. When the noodles are cooked, drain them in a sieve and rinse the noodles under cold water</li>
    <li>Peel & grate vegetables thinly, chop large mushrooms into large chunks</li>
    <li>In a small bowl mix together the soy, honey, ketchup and lemon juice. Have a taste - it should be tangy but sweet. You can add a little more of the ingredients as needed.</li>
    <li>Heat a large frying pan or wok and add the oil. Add the garlic and stir fry for a few seconds, then add the grated carrots, spring onions and the beans or peas.</li>
    <li>Stir fry for two minutes on a high heat before adding the sauce and a splash of water.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked noodles to the stir-fried ingredients along with the beansprouts if you are using them. Stir the chow mein for a couple of minutes over a high heat to finish the dish. Serve in a bowl - try using chopsticks!</li>
  </ol>
